Welcome to my personal website.

I am Jingxuan Geng, a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Professor Saif Benjaafar. I received my Ph.D. from the Fox School of Business at Temple University under the guidance of Professors Guangwen Kong and Subodha Kumar. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Management Information Systems from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

My research interests include Sharing Economy and Marketplace Innovation, Service Operations, Data-driven Research, Machine Learning, Behavioral Operations Management, and Retailer Competition.
